# Django Security Implementations and Best Practices

This project demonstrates how to implement **advanced security measures** in a Django application to protect against common vulnerabilities such as **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, **SQL Injection**, and **insecure HTTP communication**.

---

## üìò Project Overview

The project focuses on strengthening Django‚Äôs built-in security layers by configuring secure settings, enforcing safe data handling, and applying best practices for protecting user data and web interactions.

---

## üîê 1. Secure Settings Configuration

Security configurations have been added in:

üìÑ `LibraryProject/LibraryProject/settings.py`

```python
# --- Security Settings ---
DEBUG = False  # Disable debug mode in production

SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True               # Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True             # Prevent MIME-type sniffing
X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'                       # Prevent clickjacking

CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True                      # Ensure CSRF cookie is sent only over HTTPS
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True                   # Ensure session cookie is sent only over HTTPS

SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True                     # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')  # Trust HTTPS header from proxy


Purpose

These configurations enforce HTTPS-only communication, protect cookies, and guard against client-side attacks like clickjacking or XSS. 

2. CSRF Protection in Forms

All templates containing forms include {% csrf_token %} to defend against CSRF attacks.

Example: templates/book_form.html

#<form method="post">
#  {% csrf_token %}
#  {{ form.as_p }}
#  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
#</form>

Verification

Inspect the form source in the browser: it should contain a hidden input named csrfmiddlewaretoken.

If missing, Django will automatically raise a 403 Forbidden error ‚Äî confirming CSRF protection works.

Safe Data Access with the ORM

To prevent SQL Injection, all database operations use Django‚Äôs ORM instead of raw SQL queries.

# ‚úÖ Safe Example
books = Book.objects.filter(title__icontains=query)

# ‚ùå Unsafe Example (vulnerable to SQL injection)
Book.objects.raw(f"SELECT * FROM bookshelf_book WHERE title = '{query}'")

‚úÖ Verification

Review your code to ensure .filter(), .get(), or .exclude() methods are used.

Avoid dynamic string concatenation in SQL queries.
